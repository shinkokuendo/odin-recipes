      <h3>Filipino Pork Adobo with Pineapples</h3>
      <p>
         Filipino's adobo is known all through out the world. The taste varies depending on where you are from. Mostly, we don't put that much ingredients in it. Well, the reason is simple, we want to eat pork that is flavorful but we want it to be cheap. We filipinos were known to be a family oriented people and of course, whatever our meal is, should be shared with everyone in the family. You can just cook the pork with soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar, salt and pepper to taste. Though, sometimes, we replace sugar with pineapples. So, you see, assumming that you had a sugar, salt, pepper, soy and vinegar in your house, the only thing that you will buy is the pork. That is how practical that dish is.
